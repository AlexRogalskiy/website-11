# Contributing to Amethyst's Website

Thank you for your interest in contributing! There are many ways to
contribute, and we appreciate all of them. 

If you have questions, please make a post on [our forums][fm] or
hop on our Discord's [#website][dc] channel.

As a reminder, all contributors are expected to follow the Amethyst [Code of Conduct][coc].

## Bug Reports
[bug-reports]: #bug-reports

If you have the chance, before reporting a bug, please [search existing
issues](https://github.com/amethyst/website/search?q=&type=Issues&utf8=%E2%9C%93),
as it's possible that someone else has already reported your error. This doesn't
always work, and sometimes it's hard to know what to search for, so consider this
extra credit. We won't mind if you accidentally file a duplicate report.

Opening an issue is as easy as following [this
link](https://github.com/amethyst/website/issues/new) and filling out the fields.
