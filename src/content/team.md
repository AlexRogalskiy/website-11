# Team

Below you can find a roster of the current and former Amethyst Foundation volunteers. As we are a 501(c)(3) non-profit, we have a bit more formal governing structure than a typical open-source project.

## Roster

### Trusted Contributors

This is someone who has regularly contributed to the codebase, and has been recognized by being given additional access to repos and/or Discord and Discourse. This is the first step towards becoming a Member.

- Nolan
- CBenoit

### Members

Once someone has contributed for a few months, they can apply to become a full Member of the Amethyst Foundation if they wish. This comes with additional access to the various repos, as well as placement on one of the teams.
