It is our great pleasure to announce that Amethyst has been awarded a [MOSS grant](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/moss/) for the purpose of making Amethyst games run in the browser using WebAssembly.

WASM is already immensely useful as a way to showcase engine features, game prototypes or even "try *right now* before you buy" game demos. There's also a good chance we'll see a resurgence of FLASH-style games, except this time on a completely open platform.

The funding of $10,000 will enable us to pay 5+ of our developers for some focused sprints in the following key areas:

1. WASM Renderer (2D, 3D, UI)
2. Documentation revamp to include WASM
3. Parallelism in WASM

We will also commit to contributing upstream as much as possible. Our road to the browser has been significantly shortened thanks to the likes of [winit #797](https://github.com/tomaka/winit/pull/797) and [gfx-rs #2554](https://github.com/gfx-rs/gfx/pull/2554) leading the way. Wherever possible we will aid these ongoing efforts to make WASM compatibility easily achievable by anyone working within the Rust gamedev ecosystem.

This marks a critical milestone for us as a [foundation](https://www.amethyst.rs/blog/non-profit-announce/). One of our primary goals for 2019 is to start exploring paths to sustainability for our project and fellow team members. With this grant Mozilla has joined the ranks of [early donors and sponsors](http://www.amethyst.rs/donate/) who have deemed Amethyst worthy of investment. We've only just begun to demonstrate the value Amethyst can bring to its stakeholders and the ecosystem we joyfully inhabit.
