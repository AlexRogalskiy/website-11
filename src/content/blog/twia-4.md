Hello and welcome to the fourth issue of *This Week in Amethyst*, a blog
bringing you the latest changes and updates regarding the Amethyst game engine
every week. If you have any suggestions or ideas, feel free to call me out on
[Gitter][gc].

[One pull request][ep] for the engine was proposed this week, but hasn't landed
yet.

## What's cooking on master?

### Notable additions

* Work on fast and efficient component storage has begun on the [ecs branch][ec]
  (thanks to [@lschmierer][ls] for the initial [`AnyVec`][av] implementation).
  [@Oflor][of] is proposing another, possibly faster approach with
  [pull request #21][e21].

## Other announcements

As the changes above suggest, we have settled on rolling our own
entity-component-system library for Amethyst, rather than using existing
solutions. This was done for reasons of efficiency and thread-safety. Join the
discussion on [engine issue #10][e10] and on [the public Gitter chat][gc].

The drafted [parallel renderer design diagram][rd] is still open for public
feedback. Please see [engine issue #19] if you have any suggestions or comments
before implementation begins.
