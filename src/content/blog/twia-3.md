Hello and welcome to the third issue of *This Week in Amethyst*, a blog
bringing you the latest changes and updates regarding the Amethyst game engine
every week. If you have any suggestions or ideas, feel free to call me out on
[Gitter][gc].

[gc]: https://gitter.im/amethyst/general

Three pull requests, [two in the engine][ep] and [one in the tools][tp]
landed this week.

## What's cooking on master?

### Notable additions

* [Version 0.2.1 of Amethyst has been successfully rolled out!][e18] Both the
  engine and the CLI tool repositories have seen some major internal
  restructuring to increase modularity, fixing [engine issue #13][e13].

[e18]: https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/pull/18
[e13]: https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/issues/13

* The `amethyst` crate now re-exports two sub-crates: `amethyst_engine` (the
  core game engine), and `amethyst_renderer` (the rendering system). More crates
  are forthcoming.
* [The `amethyst_cli` repository has been renamed to `amethyst_tools`.][at] This
  will host the entirety of Amethyst's future tool suite.

[at]: https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst_tools

* We have adopted a leaner, meaner change log format ([engine issue #17][e17],
  [tools issue #5][t5]).

[t5]: https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst_tools/issues/5

* [All of the renderer code has been removed][e7] and its backend will be
  rewritten over [GFX][gf]. Thanks to [@kvark][kv] of the GFX project for the
  collaboration!

### Breaking changes

* Due to engine restructuring, use statements must be updated to
  `amethyst::engine`.
* [`amethyst_cli`][ac] has been discontinued. Please install
  [`amethyst_tools`][at] instead!

## Other announcements

[A revamped parallel renderer design diagram][rd] has been drafted and is in
need of public feedback before any implementation can begin. Please see
[engine issue #19][e19] for details.

More feedback is still needed on the thread-safe ECS design tracked by
[engine issue #10][e10]. Should we use existing ECS solutions, or should we
write our own? Leave your input there.
