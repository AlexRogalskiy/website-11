Hello and welcome to a special edition of This Week in Amethyst! We have some exciting news to share with the community.

## Amethyst Foundation

We are happy to announce the formation of the Amethyst Foundation. It is a non-profit dedicated to supporting the Amethyst engine and its associated technologies.

As Amethyst grows and evolves, we will continue to depend on the contributions of volunteers. Until now, we havenâ€™t had a clear way for people to contribute other than by coding; now we do! You can donate directly to the Amethyst Foundation via the form below. We thank you for any contribution you can make!

You can find additional information and answers to frequently asked questions [here](https://community.amethyst-engine.org/t/amethyst-foundation-faq/), and a list of volunteer positions [here](https://community.amethyst-engine.org/c/help-wanted).

## Community Forums
The second item is the creation of a dedicated [community forum](https://community.amethyst-engine.org). As we grow, Discord is proving more and more difficult to have long-form discussions, especially with contributors across so many timezones. Critical discussions were sometimes not seen by members who were not there when it happened, and had to scroll back through hours of chat.

To mitigate this issue, we set up Discourse-based forums. Discord is still used for casual chat, but the forums have already proven to be much easier to follow. Please try to move to the forum whenever you feel something is becoming a valuable discussion.

## Thank You
We want to thank everyone for their continued support, and we look forward to seeing continued growth for both the community and the project as a whole in 2019!
