## What's cooking on master?

### Notable additions

* [Plenty of work has landed on the ecs branch this week!][ec] The revamped
  component storage and retrieval code, [proposed last week][e21] by
  [@Oflor][of], has finally landed. [@lschmierer][ls] also wrote a set of
  benchmarks that will help us identify performance bottlenecks as we continue
  to refine our designs.

[of]: https://github.com/Oflor

* [Version 0.2.4 of `amethyst_tools` has been released!][at] Lots of
  bug-stomping and code cleanup in the latest version of the command-line build
  tool, largely thanks to [@White-Oak][wo]. This release fixes tool-side issues
  [#7][t7], [#8][t8], [#9][t9], and [#10][t10].

* The build tool [now returns a non-zero exit code if Cargo errors out][t15],
  and the [`tests.sh` script now halts properly][t14] when tests fail, fixing
  tools issue [#13]. Thanks again, [@White-Oak][wo]!
