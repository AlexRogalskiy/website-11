## Other announcements

Right now, there are some experiments being done on the [ecs branch][ec]
combining the traditional entity-component-system with
[tomaka's suggested MVC-with-parallelism design.][mv].

Clearly, the `World` struct containing our entities and components is
analogous to the *model* in MVC. But systems typically require mutable state for
strictly read-only operations, so they don't fit into either *views* or
*controllers*, nor are they easy to parallelize.

However, there are two possible ways to remedy this issue.

1. Systems are split into separate traits: Updaters and Viewers. The Viewers
   only require read access to the `World`, so they can run in parallel.
   Updaters request mutable access to the `World` and submit a list of changes
   they want to make to the content. These changes are applied serially
   according to a predetermined priority.
2. Systems are kept as one unit (perhaps renamed to "Processors" for clarity),
   and they all read the `World` struct in parallel but can optionally submit
   changes to the `World` which are applied serially once everyone has finished
   reading.

What do you think about these approaches? Leave your thoughts in the
[Gitter chat][gc].
