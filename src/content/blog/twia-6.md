### Notable additions

* A 2013 presentation titled [*Bitsquid: Behind The Scenes*][bs] has been added
  to the list of design inspiration documents. It covers a variety of topics,
  namely data-oriented design, job parallelism, rapid game development, and
  lessons learned from the game industry. Huge thanks to BitSquid developer
  [@niklasfrykholm][nf] of Autodesk for making this summary!

[Draft 2.0 of the renderer diagram was published to master this week.][rd]
The design has been simplified considerably with the elimination of intermediate
representation (IR) from the renderer, originally conceived for providing
network transparency and tool slaving capabilities.
[This responsibility has been moved upward to the engine level][el].
allowing for things like [SFM][sf]-style demo record and replay and other
goodies. Please leave your thoughts on [engine issue #19][e19].

Some meta-news: starting next issue, TWIA's release schedule will shift from
every Monday to every Sunday. This is to get our newsletter in sync with
[*This Week in Rust*][tw] so readers aren't stuck reading last week's post
every time. Hopefully this will make things more convenient in the long run!
