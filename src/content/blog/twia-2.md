Hello and welcome to the second issue of *This Week in Amethyst*, a blog
bringing you the latest changes and updates regarding the Amethyst game engine
every week. If you have any suggestions or ideas, feel free to call me out on
[Gitter][gc].

## What's cooking on master?

### Notable additions

* [Amethyst now builds correctly on stable and beta Rust release channels!][e3]
  However, this might not remain for long, as the unstable `std::boxed::FnBox`
  is going to be incorporated soon. For those on stable Rust, get it while you
  can!

* [With that in mind, issue #11 has been resolved.][e11]. Further emphasis on
  Amethyst's reliance on nightly Rust features is put in the Amethyst book's
  "Hello World" tutorial. Thanks for the pull request, [@cooperra][co]!

* As part of [issue #13][e13], the engine has been split into multiple
  sub-crates: `amethyst_engine` and `amethyst_renderer`.

* [The state machine gained some unit tests!][st] Thanks for the pull request,
  [@Oflor][of]!

* [Unit tests have been moved into the `tests` folder][ut], which isn't quite
  idiomatic practice but is a good enough solution for now. Thanks again to
  [@Oflor][of]!
