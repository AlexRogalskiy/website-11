## Announcements

- Amethyst is considering participating in Google's Summer of Code, but we need
more mentors!  If you'd like to volunteer please let us know on [#412][412].

- We've determined we'll be moving the blog to an "as-needed" basis.  So our
updates are going to be irregular.  We're never completely sure when we'll be
ready to write a new post, so we've stopped trying to commit to a timetable.

## What's cooking on develop?

### Notable additions

A lot of work has happened since the 0.5 release, so only major feature PRs will
be in this list.  There are many other heroes who worked on this release that
we don't have room to list here.  Ordered by PR number descending:

- [#489][489] by [@Xaeroxe][xr]: UI text input!  Amethyst can now receive typed
text, including copy and paste.  One known issue with this is that if the text
is longer than the field the text won't render properly.  We'll get this fixed
soon!

- [#480][480] by [@Rhuagh][rh]: Removed the `Engine` structure and replaced its
usage with the `World` structure.  This changed a number of important function
signatures so watch out for it when upgrading to 0.6!

- [#475][475] by [@Rhuagh][rh]: Added spherical interpolation to animation.
This makes our new animation system more robust!

- [#462][462] by [@Xaeroxe][xr]: Use and expose cgmath!  Game dev benefits from
consistently used and powerful math types, so throughout the engine we now use
and expose cgmath.

- [#453][453] by [@Rhuagh][rh]: Added the animation system.  You can now animate
the various properties of LocalTransform!

- [#447][447] by [@minecrawler][mc]: Significantly improved the movement options
available with our LocalTransform structure.  Thanks!

- [#445][445] by [@torkleyy][tr]: Added asset hot reloading!  Now with this
turned on any changes you make to art assets will be reflected in the game in
real-time!

- [#441][441] by [@Xaeroxe][xr]: Added a UI framework!  You can now display
images and text in your game.

- [#440][440] by [@Rhuagh][rh]: The camera is now a component rather than a
resource, hooray!

- [#435][435] by [@Rhuagh][rh]: You can now load game scenes from GLTF files.
Thanks Rhuagh!

- [#411][411] by [@Xaeroxe][xr]: Our renderer now supports BlendTargets.  This
means you can render things with transparency!  (The built in passes don't do
this yet.  However the UI pass does use this.)

- [#403][403] by [@Aceeri][ac]: Transform system rewrite, making the system
simpler and easier to understand.

- [#385][385] by [@Xaeroxe][xr]: Refactor input to be event oriented.  This
fixes the problems that existed with using input with the fixed_update cycle.

- [#317][317] by [@omni-viral][ov]: Refactor the rendering pipeline to use specs
data.  A truly heroic effort by omni-viral.  This has made renderer passes much
faster and easier to write!

### Work in progress

- 2D texture animation is in progress in [#505][505] by [@Xaeroxe][xr].  This
PR will make 2D game development with Amethyst much easier!

- A rewrite of the renderer in [#463][463] to use the upcoming [gfx hal][hal] is
going to allow our renderer to support more backends, and generally be easier to
work with!  Thanks [@omni-viral][ov]!

- [@torkleyy][tr] is currently working on adding logging support to Amethyst in
[#513][513].  This will make execution paths easier to debug for us if we get
your logs!

- [@futurepaul][fp] is writing chapter 3 of our Pong Tutorial in [#507][507].
You can also thank him for writing our first two re-written chapters in the book!

### Breaking changes

There have been so many breaking changes since the 0.5 release that any projects
using 0.5 will likely need to be rewritten in several ways.  We apologize for
the long delay we've had between releases, and we're looking to improve this.

## Calls for participation

While we don't have any specific calls for participation this post please never
hesitate to send us a PR if you've got something you want to contribute!  We're
always happy to have more contributors!
