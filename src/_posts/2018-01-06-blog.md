Happy New Year!  We're happy to announce that we've released Amethyst 0.6.0!
to [crates.io](https://crates.io)!

There are too many pull requests in this release to list them all.  If
you want to see for yourself here's a [link][ep]!

## Announcements

- Amethyst is considering participating in Google's Summer of Code, but we need
more mentors!  If you'd like to volunteer please let us know on [#412][412]

- We've determined we'll be moving the blog to an "as-needed" basis.  So our
updates are going to be irregular.  We're never completely sure when we'll be
ready to write a new post, so we've stopped trying to commit to a timetable.

## What's cooking on develop?

### Notable additions

- 2D texture animation is in progress in [#505][505] by [@Xaeroxe][xr] this
PR will make 2D game development with Amethyst much easier!

- A rewrite of the renderer in [#463][463] to use the upcoming gfx hal is going to allow our
renderer to support more backends, and generally be easier to work with!  Thanks
[@omni-viral][ov]!

- [@torkleyy][tr] is currently working on adding logging support to Amethyst in
[#513][513].  This will make execution paths easier to debug for us if we get
your logs!

- [@futurepaul][fp] is writing chapter 3 of our Pong Tutorial in [#507][507].
You can also thank him for writing our first two re-written chapters in the book!

### Breaking changes

There have been so many breaking changes since the 0.5 release that any projects
using 0.5 will likely need to be rewritten in several ways.  We apologize for
the long delay we've had between releases, and we're looking to improve this.

## Calls for participation

While we don't have any specific calls for participation this post please never
hesitate to send us a PR if you've got something you want to contribute!  We're
always happy to have more contributors!
